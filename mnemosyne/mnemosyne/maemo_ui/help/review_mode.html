<h1>Review mode</h1>

<br><br><img src=/usr/share/mnemosyne/help/review.png><br>

<br>This is a main mode of the application. Most of the user's time is spent here. This mode implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> technique. It shows cards in the order, determined by the scheduling algorithm and user's job is to grade them. 

<br>Cards and grade panel look the same as in the input mode, only left panel is different. 

<table border=0; cellspacing=10>
    <tr>
        <td><img src=/usr/share/mnemosyne/help/statistics_button.png></td>
        <td>First(upper) control there is <b>'Statistics'</b> button. It will show you statistics for the current card and overall program statistics. It actually brings you to the <a href="/usr/share/mnemosyne/help/stats_mode.html"><i>Statistics mode</i></a> (see below).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table border=0; cellspacing=10>
    <tr>
        <td><img src=/usr/share/mnemosyne/help/speaker_button.png></td>
        <td>Second control is <b>'Pronounce'</b>. It used to prononce the text. This feature is available only when text-to-speach program <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">Espeak</a> is installed.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table border=0; cellspacing=10>
    <tr>
        <td><img src=/usr/share/mnemosyne/help/edit_button.png></td>
        <td>Next control is <b>'Edit card'</b>. It allows user to edit current card (see <a href="/usr/share/mnemosyne/help/edit_mode.html"><i>Edit mode</i></a> below).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table border=0; cellspacing=10>
    <tr>
        <td><img src=/usr/share/mnemosyne/help/delete_button.png></td>
        <td><b>'Delete card'</b> is the next control. Use it if you want to delete current card.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table border=0; cellspacing=10>
    <tr>
        <td><img src=/usr/share/mnemosyne/help/menu_button.png>
        <td>And the last one is <b>'Main menu'</b>. It's the same as in almost all modes. Use it to switch to <a href="/usr/share/mnemosyne/help/menu_mode.html"><i>Menu menu</i></a>.</td>
    </tr>

<br>For each scheduled card question will be shown first. You should try to recall the answer, then press on the answer field with the text <b>'Show answer'</b> in it. After that answer will be shown in answer field and you should grade it. See <a href="#Grading 101"><i>Grading 101</i></a> for the details how to grade cards properly. As soon as card is graded next scheduled card will be shown. When all scheduled cards are reviewed you'll be asked if you want to review unscheduled cards. We'd not recommend to do that. It's better to add new cards instead and review only scheduled cards. It will allow you to utilize the power of program more efficiently. However, if you understand what you're doing you can review cards ahead of schedule.
