<h1>Settings mode</h1>

<br>This mode is for configuring the program. It has 3 parts:
<ul>
    <li>general settings</li>
    <li>appearance</li>
    <li>text to speech settings</li>
</ul>

<br>You can switch between them using controls on the left panel.

<br>In <i>general settings view</i> you can specify directories for images and sounds, fullscreen mode and opening review mode on startup. Directories for images and sounds are used when you create cards with sounds or pictures. Program will be taking pictures and/or sounds from those directories.
