<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3" id="mnemosyne" name="mnemosyne">Mnemosyne</a></h2>
<p>'Mnemosyne for Maemo' is a port of well-known flash-card tool <a class="reference" href="http://mnemosyne-proj.org/">Mnemosyne</a> to <a class="reference" href="http://www.maemo.org/">Maemo</a> platform.</p>
<p>The Mnemosyne software resembles a traditional flash-card program to
help you memorise question/answer pairs, but with an important twist:
it uses a sophisticated algorithm to schedule the best time for a card
to come up for review. Difficult cards that you tend to forget quickly
will be scheduled more often, while Mnemosyne won't waste your time on
things you remember well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4" id="spaced-repetition" name="spaced-repetition">Spaced Repetition</a></h2>
<p>When you have memorised something, you need to review that material,
otherwise you will forget it. However, as you probably know from
experience, it is much more effective to space out these revisions over
the course over several days, rather than cramming all the revisions in
a single session. This is what is called the spacing effect.</p>
<p>During the past 120 years, there has been considerable research into
these aspects of human memory (by e.g. Ebbinghaus, Mace, Leitner and
Wozniak). Based on the work of these people, it was shown that in order
to get the best results, the intervals between revisions of the same
card should gradually increase. This allows you to focus on things you
still haven't mastered, while not wasting time on cards you remember
very well.</p>
<p>You can find more information about spaced repetition in <a class="reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">this wikipedia article</a></p>
<p>It is clear that a computer program can be very valuable in
assisting you in this process, by keeping track of how difficult you
find an card and by doing the scheduling of the revisions. Let's see
how this works in practice in the Mnemosyne program.</p>
<p>The Mnemosyne algorithm is very similar to SM2 used in one of the
early versions of SuperMemo. There are some modifications that deal
with early and late repetitions, and also to add a small, healthy dose
of randomness to the intervals.</p>
<p>Supermemo now uses SM11. However, we are a bit skeptical that the
huge complexity of the newer SM algorithms provides for a statistically
relevant benefit. But, that is one of the facts we hope to find out
with our data collection.</p>
<p>We will only make modifications to our algorithms based on common
sense or if the data tells us that there is a statistically relevant
reason to do so.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" id="common-principles-of-mnemosyne-usage" name="common-principles-of-mnemosyne-usage">Common principles of Mnemosyne usage</a></h1>
<p>You can use Mnemosyne to study anything. In addition to unicode text
(meaning all human languages are supported), you can add pictures and
sounds to cards.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" id="how-do-i-add-cards" name="how-do-i-add-cards">How do I add cards?</a></h2>
<p>You can make your flash cards however you want. One point to keep in
mind, though, is that it will probably be easier on you if you limit
each flashcard to one "thing" you are trying to remember.</p>
<p>An exception to this is foreign language study, where you have a
word to memorize and you want to learn both the meaning and the
pronunciation-- Mnemosyne includes a special feature for this.</p>
<p>For more recommendations on how to make the cards, you can read <a class="reference" href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 Rules of Formulating Knowledge from the SuperMemo website</a>. SuperMemo is the commercial software that inspired Mnemosyne.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" id="grading-101" name="grading-101">Grading 101</a></h2>
<p>The software will present you with a question, and your task is
trying to remember the answer. Afterwards, you rate yourself on a scale
between 0 and 5. These ratings will be used in computing the optimal
revision schedule. Let's see what these grades mean.</p>
<p>Grades 0 and 1 are used if you don't know the answer yet, or if you
have forgotten it. A card with grade 1 is starting to get more familiar
than one with grade 0, and will be repeated less often.</p>
<p>The software will keep on asking you these questions until you give
them a grade 2 or higher (the exact grade doesn't matter). Grade 2
basically means that you think you'll be able to remember the card for
at least one or two days. It signals the transition between short and
long term memory.</p>
<p>So now you've memorised this new card. Mnemosyne will next try to
make sure that you do not forget it anymore. It will schedule the next
revision of this card to some future date, when it thinks you'll still
be able to remember it with some effort, without having forgotten it
completely. This is the most efficient for the learning process.</p>
<p>If in the future Mnemosyne asks you the question too soon, and
you're able to remember it without any effort, you rate the card a 5.
The program will take this into account by waiting a lot longer before
asking you this question again. (If you know a card really well, you
may need to consistently give it a 5 the first several times. As long
as you keep giving the card a 4 or 5, Mnemosyne will keep increasing
the interval-- there is no limit, and cards will gradually develop a
year or more between repetitions).</p>
<p>If Mnemosyne gets it just right, so that you remember it, albeit with some effort, you use grade 4.</p>
<p>If on the other hand it takes you significant effort to remember the
answer, and you think the software has waited too long to ask you this
question, then rate the card 3.</p>
<p>If you fail to remember it altogether, rate it either 0 or 1, and
Mnemosyne will keep on asking you this question until you think you'll
be able to remember it again for a few days.</p>
<p>For best results, it is suggested to do your revisions every day,
although Mnemosyne will try to cope as well as possible if you postpone
your revisions or if you want to learn ahead of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" id="initial-grades-for-cards" name="initial-grades-for-cards">Initial grades for cards</a></h2>
<p>When first entering cards, you will have to assign a grade. If you
don't know the card, give it a 0 or 1. If you do know the card, give
higher grades, and the higher the grade, the longer the initial
interval will be.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" id="reviewing-the-cards" name="reviewing-the-cards">Reviewing the cards</a></h2>
<p>When you start Mnemosyne, it will automatically present you with any
cards that have been scheduled for review that day (plus any cards from
previous days that you missed). To do your review, simply click on Show
Answer, add a grade, and you're on to the next card.</p>
<p>For the best performance of your memory and the Mnemosyne algorithm,
you should do your entire scheduled review each day. If this is not
possible, it's not a major worry-- Mnemosyne will automatically
postpone the cards for you. However, if you frequently miss days, your
recall will suffer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10" id="oranizing-your-cards-using-tags" name="oranizing-your-cards-using-tags">Oranizing your cards using tags</a></h2>
<p>To divide your entire card set to parts we recommend using tags. You
can assign several tags to one card. When you activate or deactivate
tags tagged cards are included or excluded from the review process
respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11" id="working-with-large-numbers-of-new-cards" name="working-with-large-numbers-of-new-cards">Working with large numbers of new cards</a></h2>
<p>By default, Mnemosyne will only show you 10 different cards you've
put in grade 0 at once. This is because it does not make sense to try
and memorise e.g. 100 new cards all at once.</p>
<p>We recommend only going through a limited number of new cards each
day, in order to help Mnemosyne achieve a better spread of your
workload when reviewing those cards again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12" id="maximum-interval-between-repetitions" name="maximum-interval-between-repetitions">Maximum interval between repetitions</a></h2>
<blockquote>
There is no maximum interval between repetitions, and this period can exceed one year.</blockquote>

<p>Don't worry too much! Do as many cards as you feel like to catch up, the rest will be automatically rescheduled to the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14" id="advanced-grading" name="advanced-grading">Advanced Grading</a></h2>
<p>Here is some additional information about what happens when you
grade cards. This information is not necessary to successfully use the
program and is intended only for advanced users.</p>
<p>If you grade a card successfully (2-5), the card is scheduled again
for a future date. If you grade a card unsuccessfully (0-1), the card
is placed in the "unmemorized" pile and is available again for review
after you finish the repetitions scheduled for the current day.</p>
<p>All cards have an "easiness" factor which the algorithm uses to
schedule the interval between repetitions. It is basically the factor
with which the old interval is multiplied in order to get the new one.
Note that for the first repetitions, the intervals corresponding to the
different grades won't be very different, but as you see the card more
often, the differences become larger. The default value of the easiness
is 2.5, and it cannot go below 1.3, so intervals always increase if you
grade a card 2 or higher. Also note that for the first repetitions, the
intervals corresponding to the different grades won't be very
differentThe easiness factor is not generally presented to the user
because its usefulness is limited to the algorithm's computations.</p>
<p>If you select grade 4, the easiness factor is unchanged and the card
is scheduled for future repetition based on the previous record of
repetitions.</p>
<p>If you select grade 5, the easiness factor is increased and the card
is scheduled for future repetition based on the previous record of
repetitions.</p>
<p>If you select grade 2 or 3, the easiness factor is decreased and the
card is scheduled for future repetition based on the previous record of
repetitions.</p>
<p>If you select grade 0 or 1, the easiness factor is unchanged and the card is put back in the stack of unmemorised cards.</p>
