Congratulations -- you have successfully installed and launched this application.
Now, simply place your content in this folder and watch it being served. A few
final tips before you are getting started:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>static</code> subfolder for as much content (think css, images and so on)
as possible. It will be served more efficiently and use less of your quota.</li>
<li>Use the <code>djhtml</code> file extension to embed django templates into your site.</li>
<li>Files outside the static folder that start with an underscore are considered invisible.
They will not be served by this application. Use them for templates that are used by other content.</li>
</ul>
